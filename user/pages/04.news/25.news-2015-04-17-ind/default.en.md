While economic development must pay attention to environmental protection, as after the introduction of the most stringent environmental laws, environmental tax has become a hot issue. Environmental tax or environmental tax on first reference, has been difficult to accurately verified, but for a long time, scholars from domestic to deputies, a lot of people concerned about the environmental tax reform. At least from a decade ago, there were clear environmental tax reform proposals, but now the countdown environmental tax reform.

Green taxes, also known as green tariff ( Environmental Tariff ), also known as green tariffs ( Green Tariff ) or ecological tariffs ( ECO-Tariff ), it is an international trade protective behavior of pollution.

　　After years of discussion, and now the central actively promote environmental tax attitude has made it clear. Whether the government work report written two sessions green tax legislation, the provisions of new environmental laws or proposed, are described environmental taxes already in full swing.

"Good environmental tax legislation." Since , 2015 Nian 3 Yue 5 May, Li Jiabao in his government work report "points" in the name of green taxes, green taxes to promote the work time has become the focus of public attention.

　　Now, a related green taxes " heavy news " came a few days ago, the State Administration of Taxation Director Wang disclosed that " green tax program has been submitted to the State " .

　　3 months 31 days, in the first 24 Ge National Tax Awareness Month to open the occasion, the State Administration of Taxation held a forum taxpayer, Wang talked face to face with the taxpayer " tax thing " , said the environmental pollution problems for the future of tax reform to to develop green taxation, environmental protection industry is a green industry, to increase tax support.

　　This news seems to many experts, it showed that " green tax reform legislation has been gradually make substantial progress " .

　　For the academic years , " long-awaited " green taxes, Wang also gave a relatively objective evaluation, " green taxes does not solve all the problems, but also the comprehensive management, coordination of various departments to promote " .

　　Director of the Research Center of China University of Political Science and Taxation Law Shizheng Wen weekend in an interview with reporters, said the rule of law, how to levy environmental taxes still more reasonable comprehensive and detailed research, supporting the building of the system and improve the " environmental tax tax system ," the whole establishment, etc., environmental taxes are environmental effects can really play an important safeguard.

　　" Long-awaited hard to come out ."

　　" Not easy, really not easy. " When he learned that a green tax program has been submitted to the State news Jia Kang, vice president of China Society of Finance to issue such a sigh.

　　This is Jia Kang " heartfelt " feeling, because for years he has been committed to promoting the environmental tax reform. In two of the country this year, Jia Kang, a CPPCC National Committee members submitted proposals, "to speed up the environmental tax legislative process", which is not the first time he called on environmental protection tax, similar proposals he has put a lot of years.

　　" It should be said academic environmental tax appeal has not stopped. " And, like Jia Kang, Shi Zhengwen environmental tax also has a long-term attention and study, and participated in a number of topics related to green tax legislation discussed.

　　" In fact, when we first discussed environmental taxes is referred to as the ' environmental tax ' , but has now been replaced by a unified ' green taxes ' . " Shizheng Wen told the rule of law Weekend reporter, this formulation change is primarily to better highlights the purpose of green taxes for environmental protection.

　　With the continuous economic development, human problems and the environment more and more prominent, in order to better balance economic development and environmental protection, Britain and other countries began to study and environmental taxes from the eighties and nineties. Shizheng Wen introduced in China, although the consumption tax, corporate income tax and sewage charges of Environmental charges are eco-friendly, but it has no specific tax system for environmental protection, in order to achieve national sustainable development strategies, scholars are constantly called levy environmental taxes.

　　" The Government first clear environmental tax legislation in 2007 Nian . 6 Yue State Council promulgated the". "In a comprehensive energy reduction program of work " Shizheng Wen recalled, in which a specific policy is " to study the introduction of environmental taxes " . 2008 , the study by the Ministry of Environment Taxes Tax Policy Department, National Tax Administration of local taxes, and the National Environmental Protection Administration Policy and Regulation Department of the three departments jointly carry out development work officially started.

　　Since then, however, progress in environmental protection tax legislation is unusually slow. For more information please refer to Chinese report released lobby environmental industry analysis and market research reports .

　　" Green tax years ' dystocia ' One important reason is that the qualitative problem. " Professor of Law at Peking University, China Research Association, Liu Jianwen taxation law in accepting the rule of law Weekend reporter interviewed pointed out that previous environmental taxes for the main purpose of what is to state revenue or to protect the environment is still controversial.

　　Shizheng Wen admitted that 2008 was proposed pollutant emissions tax reform, which was originally not intended for environmental protection, but to tax reform in order to regulate the government revenue.

　　He explained that, on the one hand our country except tax, fees and charges, fines and other revenues accounted for a large part, and not standardized; such additional charges due to the legal position is low, not enough transparency and other reasons, also led to the cost of the use efficiency.

　　" As more and more serious environmental problems, the current environmental tax purposes have reached a consensus. " Shizheng Wen said that environmental taxes is the construction of ecological civilization, green development concept, in order to protect the environment against pollution for the purpose of special taxes .

　　Environmental tax reform is to make sewage and other fees into taxes, but the current sewage charges by the environmental protection department is responsible for collection, after the tax reform, the tax authorities will be involved, which involves rights and duties of the problem and the division of interests among agencies. Jia Kang to respect the rule of law Weekend reporter interests between departments is one of the reasons the game is difficult to advance the environmental tax years.

　　However, Jia Kang stressed that China urgently needs to be determined by legislation in the form of environmental tax levy to replace the existing administrative fees for sewage, which is decoupled with sectoral interests, improve the force, more standardized use of tax revenues, " reported the program, Description from the day is not far off " .

　　Shizheng Wen pointed out that, after years of discussion, and now the central actively promote environmental tax attitude has made it clear. Whether written green taxes Legislative Councils government work report; and new environmental laws proposed " levy environmental taxes in accordance with the law, no sewage charges " provisions have been described environmental taxes already in full swing .

　　Green taxes should be " good and evil "

　　At present specific programs on environmental taxes has not yet been officially announced as a future upcoming levy new taxes, and the people full of doubt about their tax, taxable objects and tax rates.

　　In Liu Jianwen opinion, the early introduction of environmental taxes should not be too wide scope, since its focus is carried out tax reform, the initial scope of taxation can also define in terms of waste water, waste gas, solid waste and other sewage charges included. " With the advent of technology and the EIA increasing levels of new environmental problems in the future should be gradually widening the tax base. "

　　Shizheng Wen agrees, he believes the initial object of taxation environmental tax levy should be limited to major companies, as compared to the individual, current pollution to the environment , " the bulk " or enterprise. But he stressed that the main collection or final green taxes should all environmental pollution are into them, which is also in line with new environmental laws established " polluter when the responsibility " principle.

　　As another essential element of taxes, setting the tax rate is also very critical, " since it has been clear environmental taxes aimed at protecting the environment, then it should set tax rates increase the cost of industrial pollution of the environment, so that environmental protection tax function truly " . Liu Jianwen recommendations should increase the tax rate is set at the existing sewage charges based on the promotion of heavily polluting enterprises in transition, Forced enterprise innovation and technological change, " iron and steel , coal and other enterprises will suffer a greater impact " .

　　Jia Kang also agreed rates should " strictly formulated " , but he added that environmental tax rate differential treatment should be implemented, such as a number of enterprises and actively develop green and low carbon energy conservation, technological upgrading of enterprises should be given some tax incentives; higher tax rates on those excessive emissions of enterprises are applicable " to the green tax really play a ' good and evil ' role " .

　　In addition, the tax proposals Shizheng Wen also regional differences, he noted that the current sewage charges will vary across regions and economic development are different charges, as to whether the rate should be so, there is also the academic controversy.

　　" I think it is equally a moderate rate of regional differences. " Shizheng Wen said for example, such as some western underdeveloped areas, environmental carrying capacity is relatively strong, but also the needs of enterprise development, enterprise emissions can be a little lower rate applies; while some developed areas, environmental pollution is more serious, the same should apply high discharge rates to control.

　　To implement the reform package

　　" As a creation of new taxes, environmental tax legislation should not only involve their own taxes, but to implement ' package ' reform program. " Shizheng Wen think, first of this series of reform should be reflected in environmental taxes and other taxes of convergence.

　　For environmental tax levy, many companies had previously worried that will further increase the corporate tax burden. Shizheng Wen also said that the current companies have faced the consumption tax, value added tax, corporate income tax and other taxes, and environmental taxes is a tax increase, and therefore the key to how to coordinate the relationship between the various types of taxes is smooth implemented.

　　According to the eighth session of the Third Plenary tax reform " stable tax " requirement Shizheng Wen think we should implement tax increases and decreases structural reforms.

　　" Like the current value-added tax of 40% tax and 20% corporate income tax provision, compared to other countries, some of the international high. " Shizheng Wen suggested that an appropriate reduction in new environmental tax levy of VAT and corporate income tax should be given in order to ensure the stability of their overall tax burden, " which can also increase the international competitiveness of Chinese enterprises and enterprises to avoid the tax passed on to consumers. "

　　In addition to coordinating taxes between Liu Jianwen that the building of the coordination mechanism between government departments is also extremely important.

　　Although carried out tax reform, but Liu Jianwen expressed in the course of the environmental protection department of taxation and tax authorities are essential. " Prior to the sewage charges levied by the environmental protection department, they have specific experience, and have the tools and mechanisms of environmental assessment, to facilitate the evaluation of environmental identification; tax department for tax procedures and the production and operation of enterprises have a comprehensive understanding of information, better judge enterprises paid taxes and tax regulation. " Liu Jianwen suggested that future should be taken to identify environmental tax levied environmental tax collection patterns.

　　" Reform package is extremely important for the successful implementation of environmental taxes. " Shizheng Wen said that environmental taxes should be earmarked, or integrated into national budgets generally use? Whether it should follow the example of Western countries to establish mechanisms for supporting environmental tax revenue recycling, the tax revenue is recycled subsidies to some SMEs and low-income families? These require all walks of life before the final program introduced a careful study to explore the establishment of a comprehensive environmental tax tax system.

　　Congress still needs to be enacted

　　Environmental tax program has now submitted to the State, to levy taxes or just around the corner. But there are also people questioned, two of the country this year, a clear legal principle of tax law by modifying the legislation, the provisions of the new tax to be opened by the NPC's legislative, now green tax plan has been submitted by the State Council, " environmental tax levy if the law " ?

　　In this regard, Liu Jianwen gives an affirmative answer, " environmental tax levy will eventually need to decide the NPC legislation " .

　　" Green tax plan submitted to the State Council, in line with China's legislative process. " Liu Jianwen introduced the draft by the tax ministry drafted, submitted to the State Council Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council after discussions within the research, will be modified on the basis of the draft, and then to the public, public comments, after multiparty discussions and modifications will mature programs submitted to the NPC, the NPC decided by the final legislation.

　　In Shizheng Wen opinion, the environmental tax levy, there is a consensus, green taxes also accelerating the legislative process, he predicted that the State Council will publicize environmental tax program, within the last few months for public comment before the end of this year It may be submitted to the NPC Standing Committee, " if successful, green taxes in 2016 the possibility of relatively large through years of appeals is about to become a reality " .

　　" Protection needs everyone's efforts, it is difficult to rely solely on the environmental tax fundamentally solve the problem of environmental pollution. " Liu Jianwen stressed that to promote the process of green taxes for businesses and individuals to strengthen environmental awareness and public education, to enhance people's awareness of energy conservation and responsibility, " one of which is the importance of implementation of green taxes. "
