2014 China reflects the overall downward pressures on the economy, especially since the end of the total fixed asset investment in the third quarter, completed 35.7787 trillion yuan, with an increase of 16.1% nominal year, the growth rate dropped by 4.1 percentage points over the same period in 2013, which real estate investment continued to decline, making the real estate new construction area of ​​growth has significantly declined. Reflected in the construction industry project funding constraints, reducing multi-year project. Then in 2015 the trend in the construction industry, has aroused great concern in the industry counterparts.

　　I try to leave some personal humble opinion the following aspects, please correct me colleagues.
　　First, the Chinese economy from the impact of the overall trend of the construction industry to analyze

　　Premier Li Keqiang that the face of downward pressure on the larger economies, the economic macro-control, there are two options, one short-term stimulus to promote economic growth, such as the expansion of the fiscal deficit, increase the money supply; the second is to promote reform through restructuring and innovation Economic Growth. On balance, taking the second option. The second option because not only benefit the current, and long-term benefits can be maintained long-term economic growth, sustained and healthy development. According to Xinhua July 23, 2014 reported that Prime Minister Li Keqiang July 16 once again invited economic experts and business people discussion. His speech stressed that "reasonable interval" limit China's economic development is to prevent inflation, CPI controlled at around 3.5%, the lower limit is GDP growth of 7.5%. Prime Minister Lee explained 7.5% of the index is in accordance with the "security of employment" requirement calculation of (the bottom line of China's economic growth rate is 7%, which is to ensure the well-off society in 2020, the lowest growth rate).

　　According to experts the latest projections, economic growth increased by 1 percentage point, to 1.2 million new jobs, increase to 150 million people. In recent years the employment pressure on society as a whole was relatively large, 2012 college graduates 699 people, in 2013 732 million, plus the troops demobilized soldiers, and a large number of migrant farmers, must come up with 10 million per year jobs, handled properly will affect social stability. 2012 economic growth of 7.8% million new jobs in 1266, 2013 and last year, GDP grew 7.7%. Due to vigorously develop the service and to increase support for small and micro enterprises, new jobs 1310 people. 2014 To keep economic growth of 7.5% arduous task, because economic growth commonly called Troika, consumption and import and export "two horses" the force are weak. Until October 2014 the cumulative total retail sales of social consumer goods reached 21.3118 trillion yuan, an increase of 12% from January to October 2014 exports of $ 1.9038 trillion, an increase of 6.14%; imports $ 1.6267 trillion, an increase of only 1.6%, if the fourth quarter investments do not increase the intensity of this year's GDP growth of 7.5 per cent target, it is unlikely they will ever achieve.

　　The question now is can increase investment and have the money to invest? Can on investment, because in recent years there has been a kind of Chinese investment in excess of fear in the community. "Reference News" July 24, 2013 a report illustrate this worry is unnecessary data. 2012 China total construction value $ 35.45 trillion, second only to the US $ 39.73 trillion, ranking second in the world (Note: The total value of building assets, including public and private real estate, residential and commercial infrastructure, roads, railways and airport transportation and other infrastructure, power stations and water supply networks, the world's first building assets instead of using GDP to measure the wealth of a country or region).

　　2012 China Building assets equivalent to about 286% GDP, while the international average is 284%, that is only just reached the world average, it is considered that excess investment statement also unfounded. In particular, China's per capita assets of $ 26,000 building the world's top 20 and fourth, well below the US average of $ 126,000 (Singapore dollars per building assets 156,000, ranking first in the world per capita of $ 140,000 in Hong Kong, ranked fifth) .

　　There is no money to invest on issues that we can be analyzed from both public and private capital. By the end of 2013, China's central bank assets of 31.73 trillion yuan, according to the prevailing exchange rate of US $ 5 trillion, the Federal Reserve assets, compared to $ 4 trillion, the European Central Bank with assets of $ 3.12 trillion, the Bank of Japan at $ 2.2 trillion, or That is a sufficient public funding; According to online information, by the end of 2012 on private capital for the first time exceeded the state capital, so much private capital requires suitable investment channels to release. May 2010, the state issued a "State Council on encourage and guide private investment in health development" and the relevant ministries before the end of June 2012 a total of 42 issued according to the provisions of the relevant supporting documents. September 6, 2013, the State Council executive meeting was devoted to study and plan the effective implementation guide private capital investment to stimulate vitality, measures to healthy development.

　　The author in April 2014 day CCTV "News Network" program aired three saw the use of private capital in the News: First appliance business Suning stationed in the telecommunications industry, the mobile telecommunications "137" number section let Suning operation and management . Appears on the TV screen Suning staff busy installing the server has been installed hundreds, still need to install hundreds. Past Mobile, China Unicom, the Big Three telecom monopoly telecommunications industry has been broken; the second is the establishment of private capital to private banks, which is unthinkable in the past, financial monopolies have been broken, the state-owned banks Forced to face the competition, the need to improve quality of service; Third, private capital into the oil. The same in April 2014, the State Council launched in the past by the state-owned enterprises dominated the industry for 80 private investment projects involving railways, ports, clean energy, information technology, oil and gas network, coal chemical and petrochemical products. Let the market in the allocation of resources to play a greater role.

　　October 8, 2014, Premier Li presided over a State Council executive meeting, decided to again revise investment projects catalog approved by the Government to promote efficient investment and entrepreneurship, the new introduction of the "government-approved investment project directory (2014 version)," other than project, business investment are implemented records management (investment directory project is national security, ecological security and involve major national field layout, strategic resource development, major public interest projects). Less than a year, the State Council approved two amendments catalog, greatly decentralized canceled investment projects approved. A move that in the past, whether government or business investment projects investment projects approval system, has now become a part of less than 10% of government investment project approval system, less than 15% of the ratification system, more than 75% project filing system, so that private capital has a broad investment space.

　　In fact throughout the province are high-profile introduction of private capital to enter the monopoly industries. Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission July 20, 2014 released the first batch of 95 to encourage social investment project directory, estimates a total investment of 283.4 billion yuan, covering transport infrastructure, clean energy, oil and gas pipeline facilities, urban infrastructure, social, ecological protection and development, affordable housing and other seven areas. Hebei Province in September 2014 published a list of the first batch of encouraging private investment projects, 38 projects with a total investment over 210 billion yuan; September 29 Anhui first urban infrastructure PPP project officially released, involving 42 projects with a total investment of 709.53 billion; August 27, Hunan Province Posted 124 major public projects, covering 15 areas of transportation, shantytowns, the project will be private financing 175.6 billion yuan; September 23 investment projects in Jiangsu Expressway open to private capital The total investment amounted to 430 billion yuan. In the investment slowdown, the country has urgent need of steady growth in the background, many areas of Henan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Chongqing and other areas are gradually thrown a list of items the introduction of social capital. So the demand for social investment, the state has a policy to break the monopoly, the public has plenty of money, so that private capital that China's economic development are an important strategic resources are fully utilized. So much private investment gradually transformed into physical workload completed by who? Only the construction industry.

　　Therefore, under the combined effect of public funding and private capital, in 2014 fourth quarter and full year 2015, will be the stimulation of investment is very obvious, and the Chinese economy in CPI3.5% GDP7.5% range trends are sure of. GDP growth of 7.5 per cent of goals will be achieved.

　　The above is from an investment perspective, try again from the current range of major economic indicators and policies adopted by the State to analyze:

　　In addition to the previously mentioned to the total fixed asset investment, retail sales, import and export indicators, there are some major economic indicators must also be concerned about.

　　January to October 2014, China's fiscal revenue 11.9642 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.2%;
　　January to October 2014, foreign direct investment of $ 95.8 billion, essentially flat with last year, foreign direct investment of $ 81.88 billion, an increase of 17.8%;
　　January-September 2014, foreign exchange reserves $ 3.8877 trillion, an increase of 6.14%;
　　2014 first quarter, business climate index was 128, an increase of 28%; business confidence index 124.3, up 24.3%;
　　October 1, 2014, private investment in fixed assets 22.3427 trillion yuan, an increase of 23.4% over the same period, higher than the 3.3 percentage points of total social investment, private investment in total social investment in fixed assets accounted for 63.5%.

　　November APEC meeting passed by Chinese economic confidence, learning general secretary said in his speech: "The risk indeed, but not so terrible, toughness Chinese economy is the most powerful support risk prevention." According to my understanding, from the above indicators it should be seen strong economic toughness. November 3, Premier Li on the current economic situation and economic work next, held a forum to listen to the experts, scholars and business executives of comments and suggestions. Prime Minister Lee stressed that China is a developing country, must adhere to the development is the top priority, taking economic construction as the center, firmly seize the important strategic opportunities, lay development "protracted war." Development not only to maintain a reasonable speed continue to enlarge, but also to improve quality and efficiency, and stronger focus. In the final analysis it is to promote the Chinese economy has maintained rapid growth, to high-level forward. Then November 21 People's Bank of China announced that from 22 onwards, the one-year benchmark lending interest rates 40 basis points to 5.6%, one-year benchmark deposit rate by 25 basis points, to 2.75%, A-share market 24 onwards suddenly rising continuously for many years in the doldrums of the stock market showing a bull market. Description rely on monetary policy adjustment effect. The asymmetric cut deposit and lending rates, mortgage interest rates throughout the business loan and an overall decrease in the loan fund, investors see good. Nanjing has a Phoenix City real estate, the first weekend after the central bank cut interest rates, selling two hundred sets of two days, over a hundred million in sales, created a miracle in Nanjing on sales of real estate in recent years. In addition, with the opening of China's capital market, especially the A-share market through Hong Kong and Shanghai as through start, it is possible to achieve interoperability with the overseas market. Based on the above analysis, the overall trend of China's economic development for the construction industry, providing plenty of space.
