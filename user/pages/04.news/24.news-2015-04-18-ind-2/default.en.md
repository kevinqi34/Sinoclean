Water environmental protection related to people's vital interests, related to the completion of a comprehensive well-off society, a matter of great national rejuvenation Chinese dream. At present, our environment is poor water quality in some areas, heavy water ecological damage, environmental concerns and other issues very prominent, impact and damage people's health, is not conducive to sustained economic and social development. To effectively increase the water pollution control efforts to protect national water security, the development of this plan of action.

State Council officially issued " Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan" (referred to as the " water ten " ). This is the Water Pollution Control action guide current and future periods.

Plan of action, to 2020 , the national water environment quality improvement stage, polluted water bodies was a substantial reduction in drinking water safety continued to improve the level of protection, over-exploitation of groundwater is strictly controlled, groundwater pollution exacerbate the trend has been initially contained, nearshore stable and good quality of the marine environment, Beijing, Tianjin, the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and other regional water ecological environment has improved. To 2030 , the country's environment and strive to improve the overall water quality, aquatic ecosystems function initial recovery. By mid-century, an overall improvement in the quality of the ecological environment, ecosystem achieve a virtuous circle.

The main indicators are: to 2020 , the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Pearl River, Songhua River, Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe seven key river basin water quality (meeting or superior to III class) overall proportion reached 70% or more above ground level and built cities area black - odor water body are controlled by 10% or less, ground level and above urban centralized drinking water quality at or better than III class higher than the overall proportion of 93% , the proportion of poor national groundwater quality control at 15% or so, nearshore sea water quality (I, II) ratio reached 70% or so. Beijing, Tianjin and loss of use function (inferior to V drop class) cross-section ratio of water 15 percentage points, the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta region and strive to eliminate the loss of the use of functional water. To 2030 , the water quality of the seven key river basin overall proportion reached 75% or more, black and odorous water body to get rid of the whole urban area, urban centralized drinking water quality at or better than III class overall percentage of 95% or so. For more information, please consult Yu Chi Industry Market Research Center released investment consulting water treatment industry reports.

To achieve these objectives, action plan identifies measures ten aspects:

　　First, the full control of pollutant emissions. For industrial sources of pollution, urban life, rural agriculture and marine ports and other proposed appropriate measures to reduce emissions.

　　The second is to promote the transformation and upgrading of the economic structure. Accelerate the elimination of backward production capacity, rationally determine the industrial development layout, structure and size, industrial water, sea water and recycled water utilization to promote the development cycle.

　　Third, efforts to conserve the protection of water resources . The most stringent water management system is implemented to control the total amount of water, water efficiency, strengthen water scheduling, to ensure that important ecological river flow.

　　Fourth, to strengthen scientific and technological support. Promotion and demonstration of advanced and applicable technologies, strengthen basic research and forward-looking technology research and development, regulate the market for environmental industries, accelerate the development of environmental services .

　　Fifth, give full play to the market mechanism. Accelerate price reform and improve charging policy, sound tax policy, promoting pluralistic investment , to create an enabling environment, water management incentives.

　　Sixth, strict environmental law enforcement supervision. Punish various types of environmental violations and illegal construction projects, strengthen administrative law enforcement and criminal justice, and improve the water environment monitoring network.

　　Seventh, strengthen water environment management. Strengthen environmental management objectives management, deepen total pollutant control system, strictly control the various types of environmental risk, the full implementation of the emission permit.

　　Eighth, efforts to protect the ecological environment, safe water. Protect drinking water safety, scientific control groundwater pollution, water pollution control in key river valleys deepen and strengthen good water and marine environmental protection. Treatment of Urban black and odorous water, municipalities, provincial capitals, cities with independent planning built-up area in 2017 before the end of basic elimination of black - odor water body.

　　Nine is the responsibility of the parties clarified and implemented. Strengthening local government water environmental responsibility, the main responsibility to implement sewage units, sub-basin countries, sub-regional, sub-sea yearly evaluation plan implementation and urge the parties to fulfill responsibilities in place.

　　Ten is to strengthen public participation and social supervision. State water quality regularly publish the worst, the best 10 cities in the list and the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) water environment. Strengthen social supervision, to build national action pattern.

　　Analysts said, "Water Pollution Prevention Action Plan" introduced, the water treatment industry will usher in a golden period of development: water pollution control has become a highlight of the local environmental governance, the estimated total investment of 2 trillion in the water treatment industry will usher in major development period. Please refer to the latest report of China water treatment equipment hall report released " 2015-2020 China's development of a variety of water treatment equipment industry analysis and investment potential research report ."
